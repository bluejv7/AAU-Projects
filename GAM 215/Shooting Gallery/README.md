## Project information

### Unity Scene

1. Created a start scene that:
  1. Explains the objective of the game
  2. Explains the controls
  3. Allows you to start the game (through clicking a button)
2. Created a game scene that:
  1. Has a playable character
  2. Locks the mouse to the center of the screen
  3. Has 3 enemy characters that take damage and changes colors on mouse down
  4. Has a base that will eventually have triggers for losing the game (when enemies destroy the base)
  5. Has no friction on the walls so the character can slide along the wall easily

### Script Info

1. Added controller for the player to move
2. Added camera controller to operate the camera
3. Added mouse events on enemy characters to trigger damage and color change
4. Added some placeholder comments/values to add more complex interactions with enemies
